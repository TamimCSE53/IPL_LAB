        <h1>Something Important about C language :</h1>
        <p>C is a versatile, procedural programming language developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, and has since become one of the most widely used languages in the world. As a low-level language, C provides programmers with direct access to computer hardware, making it well-suited for system programming tasks like operating systems and device drivers. C's straightforward syntax, support for various data types, and ability to manage memory directly are some of its key features that have contributed to its widespread adoption and lasting influence in computer science. While C's power and flexibility have made it an invaluable tool, the language can also be challenging to learn, particularly for beginners, due to its level of control and complexity. Nevertheless, C remains a foundational language that has shaped the development of many other programming languages and continues to be an essential tool in the field of computer programming.</p>

        <h1> Internet Edition of Computer Programming Books : </h1>
        <p>Books to learn computer programming using C (C) programming language, complete in Bengali. Below are links to each chapter. By clicking on that link, one can read the specific chapter and if there is a problem in understanding something in that chapter, one can ask a question in the comments (but writing Bengali in English letters will not allow that     question). thank you</p>
